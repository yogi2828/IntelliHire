## üéØ The Problem We're Solving

**(Hackathon Problem ID: R1-05 - Enhancing Job Screening)**

Traditional hiring is tough:
* **Too Time-Consuming:** Recruiters can spend about **23 hours** screening CVs for just one hire (Eddy.com).
* **Costly & Slow:** Manual work makes hiring take longer and cost more.
* **Prone to Errors & Bias:** Humans can make mistakes or be unintentionally biased.
* **Hard to Scale:** Many companies get too many CVs to review them all properly (TestGorilla).

**Result:** Longer hiring times, higher costs, and potentially missing out on great talent.

## üåä How IntelliHire Works (System Flow)

### High-Level Flowchart

*(This is where you'll insert your flowchart image!)*

**A quick text description of the flow:**
1.  Recruiter enters Job Details in the Flutter app.
2.  A Python Cloud Function uses the **AI model** to understand the JD & saves it.
3.  Recruiter uploads CVs in the app.
4.  Another Cloud Function uses the **AI model** to read each CV, compare it to the JD, and score it. Results are saved.
5.  Recruiter tells the app to create a shortlist.
6.  A Cloud Function applies the recruiter's rules to the scores and marks the top candidates.
7.  Recruiter views the shortlist and can start contacting candidates.

### Simple Architecture

* **Flutter App:** The part the recruiter uses.
* **Python Cloud Functions:** Secure "helpers" in the cloud that use the **AI model**.
* **Firebase:** Handles login and data storage.
* **AI Model (via API):** The "brain" that understands text and helps with analysis.
